# RecipMe

## Purpose
Throughout this pandemic, many people have taken up hobbies such as baking and cooking. Our web-based project called “RecipMe” is intended for up and coming home cooks and foodies to submit their own recipes and explore new recipes. On the home page, users will be able to find, filter, and “pin” or “favorite” recipes they like. On the user’s profile page, they will be able to view their own recipes. On a separate page, they will be able to view recipes they’ve already “pinned”. Users will also be able to submit and edit their own recipes to be displayed on the home page. This project will be implemented using a MySQL server with php.
