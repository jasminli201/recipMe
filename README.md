# RecipMe

## Purpose
Throughout this pandemic, many people have taken up hobbies such as baking and cooking. Our web-based project called “RecipMe” is intended for up and coming home cooks and foodies to submit their own recipes and explore new recipes. On the “Home” page, users will be able to find, filter, and “pin” recipes they like. They can also view and submit reviews for each recipe. On the “Pinned Recipes” page, users will be able to view recipes they’ve already “pinned”. For each pinned recipe, the user can toggle between “tried” and “have not tried”, as well as filter by “tried” or “have not tried”. On both the “Home” and “Pinned Recipes” page, users can search by recipe name and ingredients. On the user’s profile page, users will be able to update their profile information, as well as view and delete the reviews that they have submitted. Cooks will be able to view and delete their own recipes. Cooks have a separate page, where they can submit recipes to be displayed on the home page. This project was implemented using a MySQL server with php.
